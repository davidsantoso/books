# books
Books I want to read, am reading, or have read. Check out the project view for where books are in that journey. There should also be some comments in each issue for what I thought about the book. 

If you're passing by, I'd be really happy if you dropped a book recommendation based on what you see I'm reading. Or if you want to talk about a book I just read please leave a comment in the issue. Disagreements are also welcome!
